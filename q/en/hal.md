There are certain numbers that have "holes" in it. Such as ```4```,```6```,```9```,```0``` have **1** "holes" in it, but ```8``` have **2** holes in it.

Putting the numbers together to form a multi-digits numbers, we can also count the number of "holes" in that number. For example ```890``` have **4** holes and ```123``` have **0** holes.

Let us call this hole counting function as ***count_hole***

## Task

Please create the algorithm of this ***count_hole*** function, and using it please create a simple program that will loop from 1 to 1000, and on each iteration prints the number of "holes" if the number have "holes", or the number itself if it doesn't have "holes".

example output:

```1,2,3,1,5,1,7,2,1,1,11,12,13,1,15,1,17,2,1,1,...```

### Expected Output

<p><sub>We expect the answer are in the form of written program or algorithm that only use basic functions of a program language, and not use third party library, or specific feature of programing language that are not a universal feature.</sub></p>
<p><sub>You can put the answer directly in e-mail body, compile it with other answer into an answer file (in doc or pdf format), or attach as a file. Please put the reference to the question id of "hal"</sub></p>

<p><sub>The code in the answer are expected to be written in any programming language that are easy to read and understand.</sub></p>
